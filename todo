- Recording
    - Why doesn't rerecording overwrite?

- Font rendering
    - Currently the "RenderEntryText" render command gets converted to a "RenderEntryQuadAtlas"
      when the render commands are processed. It gets pushed to the back of the render queue.
      Therefore text will always appear last and draw over everything else.

- pushTextFmt
    - In the works.

- platform API
    - Do we want to abstract this as a separate static lib?
        - A "shared" static lib similarly to what we had previously
        - How do we deal with the temporary stack? This would ideally be owned
          by the loader, how would this work with a static lib?
